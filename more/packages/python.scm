is given by a number of widgets. A widget is an object that may display
differently depending on the state of the progress bar. There are three types
of widgets:

@enumerate
@item a string, which always shows itself
@item a ProgressBarWidget, which may return a different value every time its
update method is called
@item a ProgressBarWidgetHFill, which is like ProgressBarWidget, except it
expands to fill the remaining width of the line.
@end enumerate

The progressbar module is very easy to use, yet very powerful. It will also
automatically enable features like auto-resizing when the system supports it.")
