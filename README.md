More packages for the Guix package manager! This repository contains
recipes for packages that I am working on. They will eventually be sent
upstream. When this is the case, they will vanish from this repo.

How to use these packages?
==========================

```sh
export GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH=$HOME/guix-more
```

That's it!
